Descriptions of the in-class activities are collected here ([PDF]({{< baseurl >}}/resources/exercises)); these were compiled from the [lecture notes]({{< baseurl >}}/video_galleries/lecture-videos-notes).

A final paper was also required: At the end of the course, students will prepare one paper, of up to 5 double-spaced pages, in which they will identify the most important lessons or knowledge gained from the course and how they intend to use these in their future professional work and/or development. This reflection paper will be a written individual work, but once the students finish it, they will be invited to share their conclusions with their peers and their instructors.
